The program starts by asking you to input a filename to load from. dso.txt is where I have my information, so you will want to load from that.
It will then display a menu. You use the arrow keys to move up and down. Select a choice by pressing enter.

Choices:
Select a catalogue: This takes you to another menu where you can pick from a variety of catalogues.
Record viewing: This asks you to input information on an object and adds it to the appropriate catalogue.
Save: This asks you for a filename and saves the information on objects to it.
Quit: Ends the program.

Choices once you have selected a catalogue:
List Objects: This lists all of the objects in the catalogue and information on them.
Search: This asks you for a number to search for in the catalogue. If it is found, it displays the item and information on it. If not, it tells you that there are no results.
Back: Returns you to the catalogue selection menu. Selecting back again will take you to the home menu.
